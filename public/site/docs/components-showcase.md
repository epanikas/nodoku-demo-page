# Step 2: _Skin_
## Skin the MD file using simple **Yaml config** and available components

![step-2](../../images/3d-view-puzzle-pieces.jpg "step 2")

Once you are happy with the message your landing page conveys,
start by skinning it up.

Nodoku skin is a Yaml file, which binds together sections in your MD file,
with the presentation blocks.

You can choose among different presentation components,
including Carousel, Hero and different types of Card components.

# Step 3: _Fine tune_
## Use configuration options to fine tune your landing page presentation

![step-3](../../images/design-table.jpg "step 3")

If the default presentation doesn't suit your needs, you can tweak it up
using the config options of each component to fine tune it for your needs.

You can change the background color, text color, borders and other
visual details of your presentation.

Normally the Nodoku components support Tailwind CSS out of the box,
so you can fine tune ivsual presetnation using Tailwind.
